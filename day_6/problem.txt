                    Queue Reconstruction by Height

Question : Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair
           of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of
           this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

 
Example :

    Input:
        [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

    Output:
        [[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]


# HINT 1
    What can you say about the position of the shortest person?
    If the position of the shortest person is i, how many people would be in front of the shortest person?

# HINT 2
    Once you fix the position of the shortest person, what can you say about the position of the second shortest person?
