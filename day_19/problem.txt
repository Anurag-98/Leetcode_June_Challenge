                                Longest Duplicate Substring

Question : Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur
           2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)

           Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S does not have a
           duplicated substring, the answer is "".)

 

Example 1:

    Input: "banana"
    Output: "ana"

Example 2:

    Input: "abcd"
    Output: ""
 
Note:

    2 <= S.length <= 10^5
    S consists of lowercase English letters.
   
 ---> Hint #1  
    Binary search for the length of the answer. (If there's an answer of length 10, then there are answers
    of length 9, 8, 7, ...)
   
---> Hint #2  
    To check whether an answer of length K exists, we can use Rabin-Karp 's algorithm.
