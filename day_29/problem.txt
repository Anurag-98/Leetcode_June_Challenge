                                    Unique Paths

Question : A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid.

           The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
           The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid .
           [To start from (0,0) and reach(n-1,m-1)]

           How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:

    Input: m = 3, n = 2

    Output: 3

    Explanation:
    From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right -> Right -> Down
    2. Right -> Down -> Right
    3. Down -> Right -> Right

Example 2:

    Input: m = 7, n = 3

    Output: 28
    
Constraints:

    1) 1 <= m, n <= 100
    2) It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.
